[![Deploy](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.png)](https://heroku.com/deploy)

A sugar-free budget calculator, inspired by [YNAB concept](http://www.youneedabudget.com/method) of managing personal finance. It is built on Rails, and intended to run on local machine or a VPS instance, like one you can rent on DigitalOcean for $5.

At the moment I have no intention to set up a public service or a distributable product. This application was built as an experiment, for personal use, therefore there are no installation guides of any kind here, sorry about that :)
