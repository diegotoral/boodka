[![Deploy](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.png)](https://heroku.com/deploy)

A sugar-free budget calculator, inspired by [YNAB concept](http://www.youneedabudget.com/method) of managing personal finance. It is built on Rails, and intended to run on local machine. Or on a micro VPS instance like one you can have rent on DigitalOcean for $5.

At the moment I have no intention to raise a public service or a distributable product. I've built this application for myself, and for this reason there are no any kind of installation guide here. You need some Ruby experience to run it :) [Brew](http://brew.sh) and [powder](https://github.com/Rodreegez/powder) may help on OS X.

And there's also [a demo instance](http://boodka-demo.herokuapp.com) on Heroku. Happy hacking!
